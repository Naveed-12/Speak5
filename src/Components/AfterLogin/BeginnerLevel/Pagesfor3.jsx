        <p>In this lesson we will learn to use the verb .</p>
        <p>
          The verb <span> to be</span> means "to be or to be". Let's take a
          closer look at what happens to the verb <span> to be</span> when we
          use it in these sentences:
        </p>
        <div className="greybox" style={{ marginLeft: "20%" }}>
          <span>I am beautiful</span>
          <h1>I am beautiful</h1>
          <span>She is pretty</span>
          <h1>She's pretty</h1>
          <span>They are rich</span>
          <h1>They are rich</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          As we could see, the verb <span> to be </span> disappears when we use
          it in the previous sentences, and is replaced by one of the following
          words: <span> am</span>, <span> are </span> or <span> is </span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we conjugate the verb <span> to be </span> , it disappears and is
          replaced by <span> am</span>, <span> are </span> or <span> is </span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, these words ( <span> am</span>, <span> are </span> or{" "}
          <span> is </span>. ) are still the verb <span> to be </span> .
        </p>
        <p>
          We use <span>am</span> after the personal pronoun I :
        </p>
        <div className=" greybox" style={{ marginLeft: "20%" }}>
          <span>I am violent</span>
          <h1>I am violent</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          We use <span> are</span> after the personal pronouns{" "}
          <span> you </span> , <span> we </span> and <span> they </span> :
        </p>
        <div className="greybox" style={{ marginLeft: "20%" }}>

          <span>We are students</span>
          <h1>We are students</h1>
          <span>They are actors</span>
          <h1>They are actors</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          We use <span> is </span>with the personal pronouns{" "}
          <span> he , she , it </span> :
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="greybox" style={{ marginLeft: "20%" }}>
        <span>He is gorgeous</span>

          To recap, here we have the verb to be again , conjugated with all the
          personal pronouns, affirmatively in the present tense:

          As we have seen, <span> to be </span> is a very interesting verb,
          because it has different meanings and uses. In fact, on some
          occasions, the verb <span> to be </span> is translated as{" "}
          <b> " to have "</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when is the verb <span> to be </span> translated as{" "}
          <b>" to have "?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The verb <span> to be </span> translates as <b> " to have "</b> when
          we talk about certain sensations or needs of the body, such as heat,
          cold or hunger.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know that many people would think that to say{" "}
          <b> " I have cold "</b> in English, we would say{" "}
          <section className="red">I have cold.</section> However, THIS IS
          WRONG.
        </p>
        <p>
          The correct way to say <b> " I have cold " </b>in English is{" "}
          <span> I'm cold</span> . To understand perfectly, let's see these
          examples:
        </p>
        <div className="row">
          <div className="col-md-4 greybox">

            <p>She is hungry</p>
            <span>We are hungry </span>
            <p>We are hungry </p>
            <span>I am cold </span>
            <p> I'm cold </p>
            <span>he is cold </span>
            <p>he is cold </p>
            <span>They are cold </span>

            <p>With contraction:</p>
            <span>I 'm hungry </span>
            <p>I have hunger </p>
            <span>She's hungry </span>
            <p>She is hungry</p>
            <span>We're hungry </span>
            <p>We are hungry </p>
            <span>I'm cold </span>
            <p> I'm cold </p>

            <p>They are cold </p>
            <span>I'm hot </span>
            <p>I have heat</p>
            <span>h's hot</span>
            <p>he is hot</p>
            <span>They're hot</span>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          As we could see, in English we must always put the subject or personal
          pronoun before the verb. For example, in Spanish, we can say the
          sentence <b> " I have cold " </b>; in this sentence, it is implied
          that the subject is “ I ”. For this reason, it is not necessary to say{" "}
          <b> “ I am cold ” </b>and it is enough to say <b> “ I am cold ”.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          However,
          <b>
            {" "}
            IN ENGLISH WE MUST ALWAYS PUT A SUBJECT OR PERSONAL PRONOUN BEFORE
            THE VERB{" "}
          </b>
          ; For example, to say <b> " I have cold "</b> in English, we cannot
          say " <section className="red"> am cold </section> ": in this case, we
          must write the personal pronoun " I " and say "{" "}
          <span> I am cold </span> ". The same goes for all personal pronouns ({" "}
          <span> I , you , he , she </span> , etc).
        </p>

          When we have a personal pronoun in a sentence, we can translate it
