          In this lesson we will learn to use the verb to be in negative
          sentences in the present tense.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let's see some examples of the verb <span> to be </span> in
          affirmative sentences in the present tense, which we saw in{" "}
          <b> lesson 3 </b> :
        </p>
        <div className="row">
          <div className="col-md-4 greybox">
            <p>no shrinkage</p>
            <span>I am John Lennon </span>
            <p>I am John Lennon </p>
            <span>I 'm tired </span>
            <p>I am tired</p>
            <span>You are pretty </span>
            <p>You're pretty </p>
            <span>you are happy </span>
            <p>you are happy </p>
            <span>he is sweet </span>
            <p>he is sweet</p>
            <span>he is wrong </span>
            <p>he is wrong</p>
            <span>She is intelligent </span>
            <p>she's smart </p>
            <span>She is relaxed</span>
            <p>She is relaxed</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-4 greybox" style={{ marginLeft: "20%" }}>
            <p>With contraction:</p>
            <span>I am John Lennon </span>
            <p>I am John Lennon </p>
            <span>I 'm tired </span>
            <p>I am tired</p>
            <span>You are pretty </span>
            <p>You're pretty </p>
            <span>you are happy </span>
            <p>you are happy </p>
            <span>he is sweet </span>
            <p>he is sweet</p>
            <span>he is wrong </span>
            <p>he is wrong</p>
            <span>She is intelligent </span>
            <p>she's smart </p>
            <span>She is relaxed</span>
            <p>She is relaxed</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          If we wanted to convert the above sentences to negation, all we would
          have to do is add the word not after the verb <span>to be</span> .
          Let's look at these examples:
        </p>
        <div className="col-md-4 greybox" style={{ marginLeft: "20%" }}>
          <p>With contraction:</p>
          <span>I am Musician </span>
          <p>I am John Musician </p>
          <span>I 'm tired </span>
          <p>I am tired</p>
          <span>You are pretty </span>
          <p>You're pretty </p>
          <span>you are happy </span>
          <p>you are happy </p>
          <span>he is sweet </span>
          <p>he is sweet</p>
          <span>he is wrong </span>
          <p>he is wrong</p>
          <span>She is intelligent </span>
          <p>she's smart </p>
          <span>She is relaxed</span>
          <p>She is relaxed</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

          In negative sentences, there are two ways to write and say the
          contractions with the verb <span> to be</span> : the first way is to
          just add <span> not </span>to the affirmative contraction that we
          already know from the verb <span>to be</span> . The second way is to
          merge the verb <span>to be</span> with the word <span> not</span> ,
          replacing the letter "o" of <span> not </span> with an apostrophe. So
          that this explanation is very clear, here are the two types of
          contractions of the verb <span> to be </span> in the negative:

          Now, we will learn how to turn a sentence with the verb{" "}
          <span> to be </span> from a statement to a question. To do this, we
          simply put the verb <span> to be</span>
          before the subject, put a question mark at the end, and voila! Let's
          look at this example:
        </p>
        <div className="row">
          <div className="col-md-4 greybox mx-auto">
            <p>Affirmation:</p>

          <div className="col-md-4 greybox">
            <p>Ask:</p>
            <span>Is he a musician?</span>
            <p>He is a musician?</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Letâ€™s see more examples to have this concept very clear:</p>

          <div className="col-md-4 greybox mx-auto">
            <p>Affirmation:</p>

        <p>
          In Spanish, when someone asks us something, we can answer with "yes"
          or "no" if the opportunity arises. For example, if they tell us:
        </p>
        <h2>Are You Hunry?</h2>
        <p>We Answer:</p>
        <h2>Yes!</h2>
        <p>
          In English we can do exactly the same thing; however, answering like
          this is too casual. For example, if we are asked:
        </p>
        <div className="col-md-4 greybox mx-auto">
          <span>Are You Hungry?</span>
          <p>Are You Hungry?</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p style={{ marginLeft: "20%" }}>We can answer:</p>
      <div className="greybox mx-auto">
        <span>And it is </span>
        <p>Yes!</p>
      </div>
      <p style={{ marginLeft: "20%" }}>
        However, it is much more usual that we use the following structure:
      </p>
      <div className=" greybox" style={{ marginLeft: "30%" }}>
        <b>
          <span>yes</span>, + subject + <span>am </span>/ <span>are</span>/{" "}
          <span>is</span>(when we use this affirmative structure, we cannot use
          contractions)
        </b>
      </div>
      <p style={{ marginLeft: "20%" }}>Let's look at these examples:</p>
      <div className=" greybox" style={{ marginLeft: "30%" }}>
        <span>Are you tired? - Yes, I am</span>
        <p>Are you tired? - Yes, yes I am</p>
        <span>Is she cute? - Yes, she is</span>
        <p> She is cute? - Yes ,Yes, she is</p>
        <span>Are they strong? - Yes, they are</span>
        <p>Are they strong? - Yes, they are</p>
        <span>Am I smart? - Yes, I am</span>
        <p>I am clever? - Yes, yes I am</p>

          Now, we will see how to answer the previous questions in the negative.
          Let's imagine that we feel super full of energy; if someone asked us
          if we are tired, we would surely answer no! Let's look at this
          example:
        </p>
        <div className="greybox mx-auto">
          <span>Are you tired? - No, I'm not / No, I'm not</span>
          <p>Are you tired? - No I'm not.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          As we could see in the previous sentence, to answer negatively a
          question that we are asked with the verb <span> to be </span> , we
          simply have to add a " <span>no</span> " at the beginning, and a "{" "}
          <span>not</span> " at the end. Or we can also use the contractions of
          the verb <span>to be</span> with <span>not</span> .
        </p>
        <p>
          The structure to respond negatively with the verb <span>to be</span>{" "}
          is as follows:
        </p>
        <div className=" greybox" style={{ marginLeft: "30%" }}>
          <b>
            <span>No</span>, + subject + <span>am </span>/ <span>are</span>/{" "}
            <span>is</span>/ <span>not</span>(or their respective contractions)
          </b>
        </div>
        <p>Here are more examples:</p>
        <div className=" greybox" style={{ marginLeft: "30%" }}>
          <span>
            Is she cute? - No, she is not / No, she is not / No, she is not{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Is she cute? - No, she is not / No, she is not / No, she is not{" "}
          </p>
          <span>Is she cute? - Yes, she is</span>
          <p>She is cute? - Yes ,Yes, she is</p>
          <span>Are they strong? - Yes, they are</span>
          <p>Are they strong? - Yes, they are</p>
          <span>Am I smart? - Yes, I am</span>
          <p>I am clever? - Yes, yes I am</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

  return (

        <p>
          Also, we can ask questions with question words and the verb to be (see
          lesson 3 to review question words). This estructure is the next one:
        </p>
        <div className=" greybox" style={{ marginLeft: "30%" }}>
          <b>
            Interrogative word +<span>am</span>/ <span>are </span>/{" "}
            <span>is</span>/ + subject / personal pronoun (+ object)
          </b>
        </div>
        <p>Let's look at some examples:</p>
        <div className="greybox mx-auto">
          <span>Where are you?</span>
          <p>Where are you?</p>
          <span>Who is Sarah?</span>
          <p>Who is Sarah?</p>
          <span>How are you?</span>
          <p>How are you?</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          We can use contractions with words other than the verb to be . Here
          are some fun examples (in these examples, we simply add an apostrophe
          to the first word and then the " <b> s</b> " of <span> is</span> ):
        </p>
        <div className="row">
