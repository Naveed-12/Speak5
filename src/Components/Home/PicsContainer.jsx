            What I am about to reveal to you is a secret that only the top 1% of
            the world's top language learners know.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's the same secret I used to learn French fluently in a matter of
            weeks, not years like most people who try to learn a language and
            fail. In fact, according to BBC Education, 95% of people who sign up
            for an English course fail to learn it. But you can avoid being part
            of that 95% with Speak 5.

          methods and systems for 10 years! You won't learn this secret in any

        <div className="col-md para2">
          <p>
            When the famous and well-known linguist, Dr. Paul Pimsleur was
            researching the fastest way to learn a language, he found quite
            interesting findings: First, it found that even though{" "}
            <span> a college-level native </span> English speaker knows and
            recognizes about
            <span>15,000 words </span> , they only{" "}
            <span> use a small portion </span> of these same words in more than{" "}
            <span> 80% of their</span> everyday conversations.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Furthermore, after years of research in applied linguistics, Dr.
        Pimsleur realized that we all <span>learn our mother tongue</span> based
        on the perception and daily repetition of hundreds of complete
        decipherable messages, that is,{" "}
        <span> everyday phrases and words </span>that we hear and imitate every
        day <span> in context</span> , which we repeatedly learn from a native
        speaker of our language, until we understand them and then use them
        perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          That is the moment when we understand and master our mother tongue.
        </span>

        className="cross2"
        width={400}
      />
      <p>
        Once I learned this important secret (and having wasted over 10 years
        and over $10,000 trying to learn a second language) I began to put Dr.
        Pimsleur's incredible discovery into practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of continuing to pay for courses where most of my learning was
        reading and writing, and some speaking practice in groups, I started
        befriending native French speakers and started paying attention to the
        phrases they all repeated and said to each other. the days. Little by
        little, and with the help of my native friends, I began to automatically
        understand everything they told me, and I was also able to express
        myself automatically, thanks to their constant and daily repetitions and
        corrections.
      </p>
      <p>
        What surprised me the most is that I began to speak confidently in just
        weeks!
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple of years later, I applied this method to learning the English
        language with some of my private students, teaching with the same
        methodology and obtaining the same incredible results.
      </p>
      <h3>THEY LEARNED MORE ENGLISH IN WEEKS THAN OTHERS LEARN IN YEARS</h3>
      <p>
        Because of this great success, I decided to create Speak 5 with some of
        my closest friends, and now{" "}
        <span>
          we have helped more than 50,000 students speak English fluently with
          our system.

      <h2>THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY YOU NEED SPEAK 5</h2>
      <p>
        The native Speak 5 teachers and I have done all the heavy lifting for
        you:
      </p>
      <ul className="points">
        <li>
          <p>
            We filter the most common words of the language and place them in
            everyday sentences. You are learning these words and phrases in
            context
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Everything you learn you listen to and repeat with live native
            speakers
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You repeat the process, as Dr. Pimsleur says, until you
            automatically understand
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You have native speakers, expert teachers, who correct you every day
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You hear the correct pronunciation and intonation and begin to
            imitate it without realizing it
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Once you know and use the most common words, you start learning more advanced concepts, and you can go as high as you want!</p></li>
